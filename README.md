This code is devoted to study the effects of the Lorentz Invariance violation in the Standard Model Extensions on the cross section of the Drell-Yan proccesss.


Setup

Conda enviroment is recommended with the installation of LHAPDF and torch library with othere basic library.

We use NNPDF3.1 NNLO set, but others sets can be used.

Coding

1- the most important file is functions.py, this script contains all the nesseccary functions for the calculations. 
2- constants.py contains the used constants and they can be changed to be more precise
3- rotation.py contains the definition of the rotating matrices from the SCF to the collider frame.
